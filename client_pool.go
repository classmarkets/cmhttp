// ClientPool creates a pool of HTTP clients that use an Îµ-greedy strategy to distribute
// HTTP requests among multiple hosts. The pool transparently distributes the requests
// among the hosts taking the individual request durations and failures into account.
// A more detailed discussion of the underlying algorithm can be found at
// https://godoc.org/github.com/bitly/go-hostpool#NewEpsilonGreedy
